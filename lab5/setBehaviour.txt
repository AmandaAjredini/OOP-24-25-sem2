Lab 5 - Explaining why the behaviour of set is not very useful.

Initial issue with Set:
- The Set stores unique values, but since ObjectContainer does not initially override equals() and hashCode(), each new instance is treated as a different object, even if it holds the same value.
- This results in duplicate values being stored in the Set, making it ineffective as that is one of the main purposes of using a Set type object.
